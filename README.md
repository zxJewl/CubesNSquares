A simple puzzle game revolving around speed.

Cubes and squares is a simple puzzle game about speed.
Unfortunate Cube is looking for more cubes to add to his collection but they have been locked inside room and the only way to get them is to complete puzzles.

Can you help the unfortunate Cube solve these puzzles?

Cubes and Squares isn't finished yet. You can follow me on Twitter @zxJewl to see updates and other things I'm working on though.

This is a very much work-in-progress project. Currently there are 6 short levels that you can play through.
The game currently only supports Windows.
